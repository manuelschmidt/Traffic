Building the application from source using CMake - sample:

We denote <src> as a directory with a downloaded trunk.

1. Enter the <src>/src/TrajectoryManagementAndAnalysis/ directory:
	cd <src>/src/TrajectoryManagementAndAnalysis/

2. Create a temporary directory, which we denote as <bin>.

3. Enter the <bin> and type:
	cmake ..
	make

Following executable files should be created:
- TrajectoryManagementAndAnalysis
- MetricsEvaluation
- ReadAndSaveInDBSample
- SaveTrajectoriesSample
- TestRunner
