We should organize this documentation at some point:

COMPUTING HOMOGRAPHIES
When computing homographies, a point-correspondences text file is created. 

"point-correspondences": contains a series of numbers representing points in the "world" (aerial image)
and points in the "image" (the video). 

It seems that the first two lines of the file correspond to "world" (ie. aerial image) points, 
while the second two lines of the file correspond to "image" (ie. video image) points. 

The first row represents x-coordinates, while the second row represents y-coordinates. 
Essentially, the point-correspondences text file contains the following:

    World:
    x1 x2 x3 x4
    y1 y2 y3 y4

    Video:
    x1 x2 x3 x4
    y1 y2 y3 y4
